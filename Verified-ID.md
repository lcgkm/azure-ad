## Virtual Word Verifiable Credentials

Normally, we need some IdPs (Google/Facebook/Microsoft) to hold/own the digital identitys. The apps has tied to some IdP that's centralized.
* IdP has contral
* IdP is centralized
* We could lose the identity and it is not portable

IdP is central approach, do we really trust it?
The regular PKI is central approach, everybody need trust certificate authorities.

### Me as my my own identity provider
* Decentralized
* Selective disclosure
  - I don't want to give the whole set of claims to someone, and we just one claim out of that
* Zero knowlege poof
  - Hey, I am 21 but I don't want to share my birth date with them.

### Trusts
We still have **issuer**, **holder/user** and **verifier/app**

### DID
Decentralized Identifier?
